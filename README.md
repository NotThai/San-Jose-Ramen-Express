# San Jose Ramen Express

The main goal of this project is to bring San Jose Ramen Express to an online platform so that we can expose the restaurant to the greater Bay Area. Also, it is to streamline the everyday operations of the restaurant to bring convenience to its staff as well as its customers. The site is currently being developed for San Jose Ramen Express, a local japanese restaurant business in the San Jose downtown area and its customers. The consumers can expect to see relevant information regarding San Jose Ramen Express such as its location, hours of operation, menu, etc., in addition to being able to order their desired foods ahead of time.
